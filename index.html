            <p>Over the last 25+ years I've made my living playing the drums and Elvin Jones has been an inspiration since I discovered him on a Wayne Shorter cassette I purchased at Vintage Vinyl in University City, MO as a kid.
               I later had the ultimate pleasure of meeting and hanging out with him in New York City in the 1990's. His style of playing was revolutionary within the tradition of jazz drumming and his playing was not fully appreciated until he joined John Coltrane's band in the early 1960's. I admire that he stuck with his approach dispite some intial disapproval and waited until musicians and listeners caught to him.
